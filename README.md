## Task 1: Number Guessing Game

### Project Description

This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built using Java, created as part of your internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The game prompts the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, providing feedback on each guess until the correct number is guessed.

### Internship Details

* **Internship Program:** Oasis Infobyte
* **Student Name:** Abhishek Kumar Prasad
* **Student ID:** OIB/A2/IP3355

### Features

* Random number generation
* User-friendly prompts and messages
* Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low
* Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly

### How to Play

1. The game selects a random number between a certain range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. The player has to guess the number by entering their guess in the console.
3. The game will provide feedback:
    * "Too high" if the guess is higher than the target number.
    * "Too low" if the guess is lower than the target number.
    * "Correct" if the guess matches the number.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK installed on your machine to compile and run the program.

### How to Run
