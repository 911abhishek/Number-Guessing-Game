# Number Guessing Game

### Project Description
This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built using Java, created as part of my internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The game prompts the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, providing feedback on each guess until the correct number is guessed.

### Internship Details
- **Internship Program**: Oasis Infobyte
- **Student Name**: Abhishek Kumar Prasad
- **Student ID**: OIB/A2/IP3355

### Features
- Random number generation
- User-friendly prompts and messages
- Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low
- Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly

### How to Play
1. The game selects a random number between a certain range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. The player has to guess the number by entering their guess in the console.
3. The game will provide feedback:
   - "Too high" if the guess is higher than the target number.
   - "Too low" if the guess is lower than the target number.
   - "Correct" if the guess matches the number.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

### Prerequisites
- **Java JDK** installed on your machine to compile and run the program.

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/911abhishek/number-guessing-game.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd number-guessing-game
3. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
4. Run Game
   ```bash
   java Main
### Future Improvements
- Implement difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) with different number ranges.
- Add a GUI interface for better user experience.
- Include a leaderboard to track the best scores.
